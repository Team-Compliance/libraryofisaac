--- Helper function to get the name and the line number of the current calling function.
---
--- For this function to work properly, the "--luadebug" flag must be enabled. Otherwise, it will
--- always return undefined.
---@param levels number? Optional. The amount of levels to look backwards in the call stack. Default is 3 (because the first level is the function, the second level is the calling function, and the third level is the parent of the calling function.)
---@return string?
