--- Helper function to get the player from a tear, laser, bomb, etc. Returns nil if the entity
--- does not correspond to any particular player.
---
--- This function works by looking at the `Parent` and the `SpawnerEntity` fields (in that order).
--- As a last resort, it will attempt to use the `Entity.ToPlayer` method on the entity itself.
--- @param entity Entity
--- @return EntityPlayer?
