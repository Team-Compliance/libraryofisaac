# Library of Isaac

Library of Isaac is a universal library full of any tool you could think of needed for modding, functioning as the complete API this game was missing. The library would be community contributable, basically acting as a built in version of #resources in The Modding of Isaac server. All the information needed able to be accessed through docs.
We plan to make it able embed code needed with an extension in Virtual Studio Code. With the extension, you could autofill functions, callbacks, and variablesl from library, automatically putting only the code necessary in its own file. Doing this would make it so the entire library wouldn't have to be put into the mod for it to function, saving resources.
We also plan to make the library available as a mod for larger mods that will use a lot of the library to minimize the amount of reused code.
