# F.A.Q.

### I found a bug in the library, how do I report it?

To report a bug, simply go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/Team-Compliance/libraryofisaac/issues) on the github page and create a new issue.

Be sure to specify in what part of the library you found the issue, the error you're getting, what you are doing to experience it.

If possible you should also, try to recreate the error in a very small project and then link that to us.

### I want to contribute to the library, how can I?

Check the [Contributing to the Library](contributing-to-the-library.md) page.
